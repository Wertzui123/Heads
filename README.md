# Credits
This plugin is based on PlayerHead by Enes5519, which has been improved by wolfgamer2805.
<br>CB-Heads only contains little of the original sourcecode though, and I (Wertzui123) have implemented most of the features.
<br>The icon is composed of the skins "Steve" and "Alex" from Minecraft.
